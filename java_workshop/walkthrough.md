# Installation and Set-up
Initial questions I struggled with:
    - JRE vs. JDK vs Java SE(as developers, we want JDK)
    - Is there an open-source solution?
I just went with the Java SE package since getting this up and running was of highest priority to me.
## Windows Users
After you set up, don't forget to change environment path to Java/bin. 

# Keyboard input
## AskingQuestions.java
I assume knowledge of strict types and System.out.print . This is an example of using keyboard input to output to console.
## BMICalc.java
New knowledge - imported a library, played with types
